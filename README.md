# Sensorable Open Source Camera
### Core Android App

This repository contains files for the core app running on Sensorable cams. The app has the core functionality needed to maintain the device, communicate with the cloud and bind additional functionality together:

* device health monitoring
* software updates
* logging
* radio control
* settings
* cloud connection
* alerts
* power management

It runs under system priveledges and must be compiled with the same key as the [ROM](https://github.com/sensorable/g935-rom).

## Installation

The app is normally baked into the ROM and doesn't need to be installed separately. Once installed it can update itself to a required version from a cloud server.

Remember to restart the device after updating the app manually (in development). That version of Android loads system apps on boot up only
